# Basic Style Dictionary

This repository houses the design tokens which see use in Milo's component library, our Figma designs, and more. The tokens are represented as JSON in `/tokens`, and are turned into usable, importable code in `/build`.

This repo allows Justworks to share design variables with standard values across our entire organization.

## Usage

`npm run build` will generate usage CSS files in `/build`

`npm test` will validate that the JSON is valid.
